"""Stackless / low-overhead function calls.

This pass attacks the deeply-nested call pattern that jitbit and the
OpenSourceJesus C-Compiler use as their motivating benchmark
(foo -> bar -> boo -> zoo, each also calling a shared `sum`). Where the
flag-packing pass removed *memory* traffic for globals, this one removes
*call* overhead.

It applies three complementary, fully-correct transformations (opt-in via
`-fstackless-calls`):

1. **Direct calls.** ShivyC normally lowers a call to a named function as
   ``lea reg, [f]`` followed by ``call reg`` -- an extra instruction plus a
   clobbered register. When the callee is a statically known function we drop
   the address-load and emit a direct ``call f``.

2. **Tail-call elimination.** When a call is in tail position -- immediately
   followed by a return of that call's value (or both are void) -- the frame
   is torn down and the call becomes a ``jmp f``. The callee then returns
   straight to *our* caller, so no return address for this frame is ever
   pushed: this is the "stackless" core. ``foo() { sum(); }`` collapses to a
   single ``jmp sum``.

3. **Frame-pointer omission.** A function that needs no stack frame (no
   stack-resident locals) and makes no non-tail call needs no rbp prologue at
   all, removing the push/mov/pop dance and its memory traffic. (The final
   frameless decision also needs the stack-offset total, so it is completed in
   asm_gen; this pass supplies the call-structure half of the predicate.)

The transformations preserve call/return semantics exactly, so the program's
result is unchanged; only the instruction sequence is leaner. This is the
standard, safe realization of OSJ's "indexed-jump / metamorphic-return" goal
(returning without spending stack), achieved without self-modifying code.
