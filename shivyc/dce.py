"""Dead-function elimination for unreachable internal-linkage functions.

Whole-program inlining frequently leaves a small ``static`` helper with no
remaining callers: every direct call was spliced into the caller. Such a
function is dead and can be dropped from the output.

Only *internal-linkage* (``static``) functions are eliminated, and this is what
makes the pass unconditionally sound without a closed-world assumption: a static
function is visible only inside its own translation unit, so every way of
reaching it -- a direct call, having its address taken, being named in a static
initializer, or being referenced from an inline-asm template -- must also live
in that same unit. The analysis therefore needs only the one TU in front of it.

A function with external linkage is always kept: another translation unit (or a
library linked later) may call it, and the compiler cannot prove otherwise from
one unit. ``main`` is external, so it is always a root.

The pass runs after inlining, so the call edges it sees already reflect the
calls that inlining removed.
