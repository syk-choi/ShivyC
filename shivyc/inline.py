"""Whole-program inlining of small, side-effect-free leaf functions.

Seeing every translation unit lets ShivyC inline a tiny callee defined in one
unit directly into a call site in another -- the canonical whole-program win,
since a single TU never has the callee's body. Bodies are captured while the
whole-program call graph is built (every TU is parsed and lowered there anyway)
and spliced into callers as a later IL pass.

An inlinable function must be a *leaf* (no calls) that touches no memory or
globals -- only its parameters, locals, and integer literals (any reference to
a value with static storage duration disqualifies it). It may, however, use
internal control flow: comparisons, conditional/unconditional jumps, labels,
and several return statements. Such a body is a pure function of its arguments,
so splicing it cannot change observable behavior; it only removes the call.

Splicing binds each parameter to a fresh copy of the corresponding argument (so
a callee that reassigns a parameter cannot clobber the caller's value, and an
argument expression is evaluated exactly once), clones the body with every
callee ILValue remapped to a fresh one (literals re-registered in the caller)
and every label remapped to a fresh label (so copies never collide), and routes
each return through a single fresh end label that assigns the call's result.
