"""Whole-program (cross-translation-unit) call-graph analysis.

ShivyC compiles each translation unit independently, so any analysis that
walks the call graph (e.g. the metamorphic-reentrancy and -O4 near-scratch
safety checks) only ever sees one TU at a time. This module parses every input
TU -- reusing the on-disk AST cache so repeated TUs are cheap -- lowers each to
IL, and merges the per-TU call graphs into a single whole-program graph.

The graph is intentionally derived from the IL (the same `Call.direct_name`
edges the existing single-TU analyses use), so it is exactly the cross-TU
generalization of those analyses. It is also independent of the normal
compile pipeline: building it never changes code generation, so it cannot
affect the output of an ordinary single-file compile.
